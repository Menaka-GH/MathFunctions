# MathFunctions
****************
This project is about the Mathematical functions such as Standard Deviation, Prime Numbers, OddEven, Factorial calculations.
Used the master loop to find the mathematical functions.
In Standard deviation calculation I have used the JSON file for the utility bill.
In that, getting the input, that is date for the invoice usage from the user and used LINQ query to find the data.
Using that data I have calculated the Standard deviation.
Using that Standard deviation, found the deviation of a data provided by the user.
Next function is Prime Number (The number divided by one and itself ) calculation. In that I used "for loop" to find the Prime numbers between the user inputs.
The third function is OddEven.  It will get the number as a input from the user and find whether it is odd(not divided by 2) or even(divided by 2).
Then Factorial function will get the user's input to calculate the factorial of that number(5! = 1*2*3*4*5 = 120 ).

#Project Requirements included in MathFunctions
***********************************************
1. Implemented a “master loop” console application where the user can repeatedly enter commands/perform actions, including choosing to exit the program.
2. Created a dictionary or list, populate it with several values, retrieve at least one value, and use it in your program.
3. Read data from an external file, such as text, JSON, CSV, etc and use that data in your application
4. Use a LINQ query to retrieve information from a data structure (such as a list or array) or file.
